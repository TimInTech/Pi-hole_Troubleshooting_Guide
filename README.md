# 🛠️ Pi-hole v6 - Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions to common issues encountered when using Pi-hole v6, including DNS resolution problems, blocking issues, network conflicts, and performance optimizations.

---

## 📌 1. DNS Resolution Issues

### 🔹 Pi-hole is not blocking ads

✅ **Solution:**

1. Ensure that your device is using Pi-hole as the primary DNS:

   ```bash
   nslookup pi.hole
   ```

   If it fails, your router may be overriding DNS settings. Manually configure your device’s DNS.

2. Restart Pi-hole:

   ```bash
   pihole restartdns
   ```

3. Check if the blocklists are up-to-date:

   ```bash
   pihole -g
   ```

### 🔹 Sites are slow to load / DNS queries take too long

✅ **Solution:**

1. Check query time:

   ```bash
   dig google.com @127.0.0.1 -p 5335
   ```

2. Ensure that Unbound or the upstream DNS is responsive.

3. Optimize the cache size in unbound.conf:

   ```
   cache-max-ttl: 86400
   cache-min-ttl: 3600
   ```

### 🔹 Pi-hole is not resolving local domains

✅ **Solution:**

1. Add local DNS records:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/pihole/custom.list
   ```

   Example entry:

   ```
   192.168.1.100   myserver.local
   ```

2. Restart DNS:

   ```bash
   pihole restartdns
   ```

## 🔧 2. Whitelisting & Blocklist Issues

### 🔹 A website is blocked even after whitelisting

✅ **Solution:**

1. Check if the domain is still blocked:

   ```bash
   pihole -q example.com
   ```

2. Force Pi-hole to update lists:

   ```bash
   pihole restartdns
   ```

3. Manually whitelist:

   ```bash
   pihole -w example.com
   ```

### 🔹 Blocklists are not updating

✅ **Solution:**

1. Manually update:

   ```bash
   pihole -g
   ```

2. Check for errors:

   ```bash
   cat /var/log/pihole_updateGravity.log
   ```

## 🌍 3. IPv6 & Network Issues

### 🔹 IPv6 Queries are not being blocked

✅ **Solution:**

1. Ensure Pi-hole is handling IPv6:

   ```bash
   dig AAAA example.com @127.0.0.1 -p 5335
   ```

2. If required, force all clients to use IPv4:

   ```bash
   pihole -a setdns 192.168.1.2
   ```

### 🔹 Some devices bypass Pi-hole

✅ **Solution:**

1. Ensure that your router only assigns Pi-hole’s IP as DNS.

2. Block external DNS on the router firewall:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -p udp --dport 53 -j REJECT
   ```

3. If the device uses DoH/DoT (DNS over HTTPS/TLS), block common DoH servers.

## 4. Performance & Optimization

### 🔹 Pi-hole uses too much memory

✅ **Solution:**

1. Reduce the number of blocklists:

   ```bash
   pihole -a -b remove_list_url
   ```

2. Reduce FTL cache size in /etc/pihole/pihole-FTL.conf:

   ```
   MAXDBDAYS=7
   DBINTERVAL=60.0
   ```

### 🔹 Reduce Unbound CPU usage

✅ **Solution:**

1. Optimize the Unbound configuration:

   ```
   num-threads: 1
   msg-cache-size: 4m
   rrset-cache-size: 8m
   ```

## 🛑 5. Debugging & Logs

### 🔹 How to check live logs

```bash
pihole -t
```

### 🔹 Check DNS query logs

```bash
cat /var/log/pihole.log | grep example.com
```

### 🔹 Enable FTL debugging for deeper analysis

```bash
pihole checkout ftl debug
```

## 📝 6. Reporting Issues

If the issue persists, generate a debug log and submit it:

```bash
pihole -d
